Endpoints

Authentication


The API uses Django's built-in authentication system to authenticate users. To make authenticated requests, you will need to include a Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN header in your request, where YOUR_TOKEN is the token for the user you want to authenticate as. You can obtain a user's token by sending a POST request to the /api-token-auth/ endpoint with the user's username and password.
